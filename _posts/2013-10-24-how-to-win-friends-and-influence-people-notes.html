<p>Notes that I've collected from Dale Carnegie's "How To Win Friends &amp; Influence People".</p>

<p>Overall, I think it's a great read and recommend it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: "If you want to gather honey, don't kick over the beehive"</h2>

<h3>B.F. Skinner</h3>
<p>Showed rewards for good behavior > punishment for bad behavior</p>

<h3>Lincoln's favorite quote</h3>
<p>"Do not judge, lest ye be judged."<br />Captures his strong belief of withholding criticism</p>

<p>"To know all, is to forgive all."</p>

<p>Principle 1: Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.</p></p>

<h2>Chapter 2: The Big Secret of Dealing with People</h2>

<h3>The desire to be important</h3>
<p>Present in everybody<br />
Identified by Freud and psychologist John Dewey<br />
"Everybody likes a compliment." - Lincoln<br />
"If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I'll tell you what you are." - Carnegie</p></p>

<h3>Insanity and importance</h3>
<p>The desire to be important drives some to insanity</p>

<h3>Charles Schwab's guiding principle</h3>
<p><br />
"I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop that best in a person is by appreciation and encouragement. There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise."</p>

<h3>Flattery vs appreciation</h3>
<p><br />
Flattery -> insincere, selfish<br />
Appreciation -> heart-felt, unselfish23<br />
Avoid flattery at all costs<br />
"Teach me neither to proffer nor receive cheap praise" - maxim from King George V's study</p>

<p>Appreciation is the "legal tender that all souls enjoy." - Carnegie</p>

<h3>A saying hung on Carnegie's mirror</h3>
<p><br />
"I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness that I can show to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer or neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again."</p>

<p>Principle 2: Give honest and sincere appreciation.</p>

<p>My learning: Everyone wants to feel important. Identify every person's good points and praise them for it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: "He Who Can Do This Has The Whole World With Him. He Who Cannot Walks A Lonely Way."</h2>

<h3>Creating action</h3>
<p><br />
"Action springs out of what we fundamentally desire[â€¦] First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way."

Hotel vignette<br />
Carnegie had rent raised on him<br />
He negotiated with manager by focusing on manager's goals<br />
Rent was successfully lowered

"If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own."

"People who can put themselves in the place of other people, who can understand the workings of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for them." - Owen D. Young

Principle 3: Arouse in other people an eager want.

My learning: Arouse in people an eager want by assuming their perspective and wanting what they want.

Part 2: Six Ways To Make People Like You</p>

<p>Chapter 1: Do This And You'll Be Welcome Anywhere</p>

<p>"You can make more friends in two months by being interested in other people than you can in two years by making others interested in you."

"It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring."

Roosevelt<br />
Always showed interest in those below him<br />
Remembered many personal details

Charles R. Walters anecdote<br />
Needed to get information on a company<br />
Overheard that the president was collecting stamps for son<br />
Brought stamps, was showered with the information he wanted

"If you want others to like you, if you want to develop real friendships, if you want to help others and at the same time help yourself, keep this principle in mind:"

Principle 1: Become genuinely interested in other people.

Chapter 2: A Simple Way To Make A Good First Impression</p>

<p>Smiling.

"You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good time meeting you."

"Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating action which is under more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not."

"Most people are as happy as they make up their minds to be." - Abraham Lincoln

"A man without a smiling face must not open up a shop."

Principle 2: Smile.

Chapter 3: If You Don't Do This, You Are Headed For Trouble</p>

<p>Jim Farley<br />
Able to recall people's names, basic facts<br />

Andrew caught a mother rabbit<br />
Didn't have food to feed them<br />

<p>My learnings: Make an effort to use and remember people's names.

Principle 3: Remember that a person's name is the sweetest and most important sound in any language.

Chapter 4: An Easy Way To Become A Good Conversationalist</p>

<p>Be a good listener.

"So if you aspire to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive listener. To be interesting, be interested. Ask questions that other people will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments."

Principle 4: Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.

Chapter 5: How To Interest People</p>

"Talk to people about themselves, and they will listen for hours." - Benjamin Disraeli

Principle 6: Make the other person feel important -- and do it sincerely.

Part 3: How To Win People To Your Way Of Thinking</p>

<p>Chapter 1: You Can't Win An Argument</p>

<p>Dinner party vignette<br />
Carnegie gets into dispute with person at dinner party re: source of a quote<br />
Carnegie and the other person consult with an expert also at the dinner party<br />
The expert kicks Carnegie under the table, tells Carnegie he is wrong and the other person is right<br />
The expert later explains that proving the other person wrong would only breed hatred

"A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still."

Truck salesman vignette<br />
Truck salesman often was defensive about his product<br />
Argumentativeness hurt his sales<br />
After reform, he trained himself to agree with customers instead of get into an argument<br />
Agreeing with customers make it easier to talk about what he was offering<br />
Became a far better salesman

"If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory sometimes, but it will be an empty victory because you will never get your opponent's good will." - Benjamin Franklin

Tax inspector vignette<br />
Tax inspector disputes the tax on a debt<br />
Stubbornly wishes to tax that debt<br />
The taxpayer stops arguing, instead says "you are probably right, I don't have that much experience"<br />
Conversation becomes a more pleasant one<br />
Tax inspector leaves saying he will reconsider<br />
Tax return ends up considered exactly as filed<br />
Learning: Inspector's feeling of importance was removed when his demands were met, but a bigger feeling of importance came from being understood

"Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love." - Buddha

"No man resolved to make the most of himself can spare time for personal contention. Still less can he afford to take all the consequences, including the vitiating of his temper and loss of self control. Yield larger things to which you can show no more than equal right; and yield lesser ones, though clearly your own. Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog would not cure the bite." - Lincoln

Principle 1: The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.

Chapter 2: A Sure Way Of Making Enemies -- And How To Avoid It</p>

<p>Telling others they are wrong.

"Men must be taught as you taught them not
And things proposed as things forgot" - Alexander Pope

Always respond to a contention by first admitting you might be wrong.

Proving others wrong will not win their good will, which is far more valuable.

Benjamin Franklin's change<br />
Called out one day about his argumentativeness<br />
Resolved to never outright contradict another person<br />
Instead, would first agree in one case, but show how the present case is unaccounted for

Yarn supervisor vignette<br />
Developed a new system for incentivizing workers<br />
First time she proposed it to superiors, was rejected<br />
Second time she proposed it, she started by asking superiors to enumerate their problems<br />
She suggested points throughout discussion, leading her system to eventually be adopted

Lumber salesman vignette<br />
Customer angrily calls complaining wood is not of grade<br />
Salesman arrives, does not insinuate the customer is right<br />
Sees that the customer actually was improperly grading the wood<br />
Salesman did not contend there was an issue<br />
Salesman socratically asks about the requirements for each piece of wood<br />
Customer realizes they got what they paid for, check is sent in full<br />
Learning: arguing would not have lead to the customer changing his attitude

Principle 2: Show respect for the other person's opinion. Never say (or imply) "you're wrong."

Chapter 3: If You're Wrong, Admit It</p>

<p>Rex vignette<br />
Carnegie likes to walk his dog Rex without a muzzle/leash<br />
One day, Carnegie was caught and reprimanded by an angry policeman for doing so<br />
The next week, Carnegie was caught again<br />
Carnegie began by admitting he was in the wrong, should pay the fine<br />
The policeman let him off, suggesting he have the dog play where the policeman can't see him<br />
Learning: The policeman was robbed of his importance when Carnegie admitted fault the second time around, leading the policeman to regain importance by letting Carnegie off.

When about to be caught red-handed, it's better to say all the things the other person is thinking before that person has the chance to say them. Self criticism said out loud > alien criticism said out loud

Commercial artist vignette<br />
Artist receives call from antsy customer<br />
Customer gloats in the opportunity to show error in work<br />
Artist admits full responsibility for error, wishes to redo entire work<br />
Customer backs down, admires willingness to account for error<br />
Customer ends up taking artist to lunch and sending him off with another commission

"There's a certain degree of satisfaction in having the courage to admit one's own errors. It not only clears the air of guilt and defensiveness, but it often helps solve the problem created by the error."

Pickett's charge<br />
Robert E Lee was massively defeated by the Union, signaling the end of the Confederacy<br />
Lee took all the blame for the failure, despite the availability of numerous alibis

Chinese father vignette<br />

Father cleaned up, wanted to reach out to son/see grandchildren<br />
Chinese tradition dictates that the son must reach out to father<br />
Instead, father broke the mold, went to his son and admitted he was wrong<br />
They reconciled and had a mutually beneficial relationship

"By fighting you never get enough, but by yielding you get more than you asked for."

Elbert Hubbard's admirable response to an irritated reader:

"Come to think it over, I don't entirely agree with it myself. Not everything I wrote yesterday applies to me today. I am glad to learn what you think on the subject. The next time you are in the neighborhood, you must come visit us and we'll get this subject threshed out for all time. So here is a handclasp over the miles, and I am,

Yours sincerely,
Elbert Hubbard"
Principle 3: If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.
