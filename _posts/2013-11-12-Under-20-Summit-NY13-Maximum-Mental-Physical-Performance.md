<p>Before leading a breakout session at this year's Under 20 summit (which you should totally <a href="http://www.thielfellowship.org/under-20-summit/">check out</a> if you haven't heard of it yet), I had a chance to write my presentation in full. Originally I used the written-out version strictly for figuring out what I wanted to say. But, when a summiter suggested that presenters put their slides online, it made perfect sense to make the draft of my presentation available as well. So here it is!</p>

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you've seen the movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding, you know something about what it's like to grow up in a Mediterranean family. Food is everywhere; food runs in our veins; second helpings are the norm and excess is expected. For most of my life, my relationship with food has been defined by gratuity. The worst part was that it was normal. I didn't question my attitude towards food. I now believe that this is one of the greatest mistakes affecting my personal development.</p>

<p>Through my adolescence I often felt lethargic and tired. In college I'd often look at a homework problem and, if I had any energy at all, skim over it. I wouldn't immerse myself in it. It was kind of living life through a glass pane. Engaging myself wholly was difficult. My support network compounded the problem: my friends and professors in college joked about the "mid-afternoon blah" like it was normal.</p>

<p>When I dropped out of college to live and work on my own for the first time, my attitude towards food changed. I discovered that my lethargy was caused by my eating habits. It turns out my lethargy was due to the consumption of fast-releasing carbohydrates, a thing all too common in the American diet. The blood sugar rush -- and the crash that follows -- contributed to years spent half-engaged and unfulfilled. In my family, diabetes is common. My grandmother has type 2 diabetes and so does my cousin in Syria, who is just a year younger than I am. My problems with carbohydrate and sugar intake seems to have been genetically predisposed.</p>

<p>Nutrition plays a massive role in our lives. This breakout session is about this realization, and how you can use the science to get up easier in the morning, be less stressed, and concentrate better. You are what you do repeatedly; adjusting your diet is your chance to become a better you.</p>

<p>You all are busy, ambitious, hardworking, and slightly neurotic people, so I know your time is valuable. I'd like to share with you four items to put on your to-do list when you get home from this amazing summit.</p>

<h2 id="water">Drink more water</h2>

<p>Low grade dehydration is a chronic, widespread problem that affects your energy, well-being, resilience, and appearance. 60-70% of our body is composed of water, and around 80% of our brain is water by mass. Yet recent research shows that 3 out of every 4 people in this room is chronically dehydrated.</p>

<p>We rely on water for cleaning waste byproducts from our system. Waste byproducts that are not appropriately removed from the body create fatigue and negatively your physical performance and mood.</p>

<p>A lithe known fact about dehydration: it forces the heart to work harder to pump the same amount of blood to internal organs of the body. To compensate for the lack of water, blood flow is diverted from the skin to more critical internal organs. The heart works unnecessarily harder to maintain important processes, and skin ages quicker.</p>

<p>You can't afford to not be hydrated. The Institute of Medicine recommends that males consume 3.7 L of water daily, and females 2.7 L. That might sound like a lot, but is tractable. I have 3 1L bottles that I fill every morning. My goal by th end of each day is simply to finish all three.</p>

<p>Another cool way to track your water intake is with an iPhone app called Waterlogged. It sends you push notifications throughout the day to remind you to drink your share of water.</p>

<h2 id="sleep">Sleep regularly</h2>

<p>How many of you wake up with an alarm clock? Your phone vibrating off the table is one of the least compassionate sounds known to mankind. Why do we start our day on such an awful note?</p>

<p>I used to have trouble sleeping at night. I sometimes would take 30 minutes, or even an hour, to catch some z's. That sometimes meant taking about 3.5 to 7 hours being wasted each week.</p>

<p>You and I can't afford that kind of systematic time loss. That time loss also doesn't factor in decreased productivity during waking hours. Bad sleep is associated with weight gain, type 2 diabetes, and impaired immune function. What are we doing to ourselves?</p>

<p>For the teenagers in the audience, the recommended duration of sleep is between 8.5 to 9.25 hours. For those 20 and up, it ranges from 7 hours to 8. Just as important as your time spent sleeping is how consistently. Committing to a hard hour to sleep stabilizes your circadian rhythm, ensuring you get the most utility from every hour of rest.</p>

<p>How do you correct a sleeping problem? For some time I experimented with an herb called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerian_root">Valerian root</a>. It is a mild sedative sold in common drugstores and taken once a day before bed. I noticed it decreased my anxiety and calmed me down, which helped me fall asleep faster. Over time my need to take it decreased and I could sleep regularly. I recommend trying it; however, if you find it still does not help you should certainly contact a doctor to determine whether your sleep disturbances are caused by something else.</p>

<p>What about when you have to pull an all-nighter? Sometimes you don't have a choice. I must start by saying that all-nighters pulled consistently are BAD. The long-term effects on the body are massive compared to the short-term win of maybe being productive enough to do it. You should pull all-nighters sparingly.</p>

<p>A few things happen when you go a long time without sleep: your immune system's capacity to regulate itself decreases, toxins throughout the body aren't removed, and your anxiety increases.</p>

<p>If you have to, you should try to counterbalance the negative effects of sleep deprevation. One way to do it is through supplementation. NatureMade's Super B-Complex includes vitamins B6 and B12, which are known to aid in the body's production of energy. This particular supplement also includes vitamin C, which aids the immune system. Taking a B-complex supplement around the time you pull an all-nighter can at least mitigate the effects of going without sleep, but again, it can never do so fully.</p>

<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>

<p>What if I told you sleeping could be as easy as dropping into bed and dozing off within minutes? What if I also told you you could wake up with a jolt of energy? Imagine what you could do if every day started the right way.</p>

<p>Research from Northwestern University indicates that a consistent exercise regimen leads to a marked decrease in sleep disturbances. Another study focusing on adolescents found who exercise exhibited much better concentration throughout the day thanks to improved sleep. Compound these effects over the long term, and you become a much more engaged, creative, and dynamic person.</p>

<p>So if the benefits of exercise extend beyond physical appearance and include increased mental capacities, we should be doing everything we can to make it a regular part of our lives.</p>

<p>Where does one start with exercise? There are three kinds worth investigating The first is flexibility exercise, the most well-known of which is yoga. If you feel that you're a somewhat anxious or often stressed person, yoga offers the double benefit of promoting muscular strength and reducing stress.</p>

<p>However, if your goal is to lose weight or gain muscle, then aerobic exercise (often called cardio) might be of interest to you. Aerobic exercise includes activities like jogging, rowing, or walking up steps. These exercises tend to put your heart rate around 60-80% of it's maximum, meaning it's effective for burning calories.</p>

<p>Aerobic exercise is also a great way for you to start being fit if you're new to exercise since it requires relatively little training. However, because it's easy to develop endurance with most aerobic exercise, the calories burned per workout decreases over time.</p>

<p>This brings us to the third kind of exercise -- anaerobic -- which is harder to develop endurance to. Anaerobic exercise is distinguished from aerobic exercise by its use of short, high intensity bursts of activity. These bursts are usually repeated over 8 to 12 sets of the course of a workout. The sets themselves place so much demand on some part or all of the body such that it the body switches to an intense calorie burning energy consumption process. Examples of anaerobic exercise include sprinting, mountain climbing, or high-intensity interval training sequences like this one.</p>

<p>What kind of exercise should you do? Assuming you don't suffer from asthma, and that your goal is not to increase flexibility, anaerobic exercise is the best investment of your time. Several studies have found that interval-based exercise produces the quickest change in overall fitness compared to aerobic and flexibility exercises. Given a tight budget and/or schedule, anaerobic exercise provides the best results.</p>

<p>If you're just getting started in the world of fitness, it might be easier to start with aerobic exercise (like running) and work towards anaerobic exercise to jump-start your journey.</p>

<p>Getting started with interval-based anaerobic exercise might seem daunting at first since it's the most physically demanding and because there are many different kinds. I highly recommend search near your home or workplace for studios, gyms, or personal trainers capable of creating your workouts for you. You have enough to think about as it is, and the guidance of an instructor can greatly increase your likelihood of success.</p>

<p>If you can't take a class for whatever reason, there are fantastic high-intensity interval training channels on YouTube to work from:</p>

</ul>


<h2 id="mind">Understand your mind</h2>

<p>I feel that one aspect of wellness we are remiss to not talk about in the health and fitness world is the role of the mind in overall well-being. Since Renee Descarte made popular the idea that the mind and body are separate entities (so called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism_(philosophy_of_mind">mind-body dualism</a>), hundreds of years have passed where the exact connection between the mind, body, and well-being was ignored.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology">Positive psychology</a> is a nascent subfield of the science of the mind that explores how to bring out the best in all people, mentally ill or not. It provides an entire set of scientifically backed methods of increasing mental wellness through exercises in self-reflection. In general, I highly recommend you set aside time to learn about positive psychology. Wikipedia has many easily understandable articles on positive psychology's most fascinating ideas. "A Primer In Positive Psychology" by Christopher Peterson is a must-read that chartered my discovery of the science.</p>

<p>In keeping in line with the goal of this presentation -- to help you maximize your mental and physical performance -- I'd like to borrow three ideas from positive psychology that can help us achieve our goals.</p>

<p><strong>Hedonic and eudaimonic pleasure</strong></p>

<p>What is the difference between the pleasure we get from eating an ice cream sandwich versus from solving a challenging puzzle? It turns out quite a lot. The former pleasure is one that psychologists have described as hedonic. Hedonic pleasures are relatively short bursts of happiness felt when you hear a joke or eat something sweet. Eudaimonic pleasures, on the other hand, are what you feel when you've had a mastery experience. You found the bug in the program; you got two bickering friends to make up; you forgave a friend who wronged you in the past.</p>

<p>One might be tempted to jump to the conclusion that eudaimonic pleasure is always more desirable than hedonic. After all, why concern oneself with short term pleasure when there are bigger fish to fry? The truth lies somewhere in the middle. We need short-term hedonic pleasures to smooth out the parts of our days that are less than palatable. Conversely, we also need to know when we do something for hedonic pleasure simply because we seek escape. Am I getting another cup of coffee because I can't actually stay awake, or am I running away from a roadblock in my work?</p>

<p>The demarcation between hedonic pleasure and eudaimonic pleasure is one worth exploring in the context of your life. I implore you to think about some of the habits you exhibit throughout the day. What ratio of them contribute to your hedonic pleasures, as opposed to your authentic eudaimonic happiness? Being aware of which is which and how much you want of both is an incredibly useful tool for better understanding your mind.</p>

<p><strong>Schwartz Value Circumplex</strong></p>

<p>What are your values? If I were to ask each of you in this room what your values are, the chances are good we'd end up with pretty similar lists. You're all ambitious, hardworking, talented, and slightly neurotic, so naturally you value work over boredom and excellence over mediocrity. The more interesting question is to what extent you believe each of these things.</p>

<p><img src="http://valuesandframes.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/schwartz_circumplex.png" alt="Schwartz' value circumplex" /></p>

<p>Pictured is Schwartz' value circumplex. It shows various values that all human societies over time have admired. Values that are exhibited by similar people are placed next to each other. For example, those who admire power also admire achievement and security. These people, however, are placed opposite those who admire universalism and benevolence. It's not correct to say that those who like power are not benevolent. Those who value power often value benevolence. The nuance is that those who value power don't value benevolence as much as they value power.</p>

<p>While all of you value all of the things on the circumplex, I am certain that you can place yourself on a certain quadrant of the model. At some point you must value tradition over change, or vice a versa. It's unlikely you will value both things equally.</p>

<p>Finding out where your values stand in this model can can help you understand the congruity  between your actions and your values. There will be situations in the future where you must trade values under the guise of tangible things. "Should I take money over control of my company?" is a question that, barring external factors, reduces to your weighting of the value of security versus self direction. Deciding where you stand on this circumplex model will give you another tool for understanding how consistent your actions are with your behavior, and whether you could be doing a better job to become self consistent.</p>

<p><strong>Maslow's hierarchy of needs</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://communicationtheory.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/maslow-hierarchy-of-needs-diagram.jpg" alt="Maslow's hierarchy of needs" /></p>

<p>Perhaps the most popular idea in positive psychology was elaborated by Abraham Maslow, who built on the work of prior psychologists to understand what factors are required to bring out the best in people. Having studied the biographies of hundreds of successful people, he arrived at a hierarchy of needs, where the most fundamental of human needs are at the bottom and the most elusive are at the top. The state of having all of your needs met is called self-actualization; at this stage you feel most independent, creative, confident, and so on. This is the height of your potential.</p>

<p>It might be odd for me to ask yourself to place yourself in the hierarchy, but I think there is something that' is brutally honest yet useful in doing so. If you feel that you lack something in this model, why is it? Refer back to your circumplex model. Do you think you should value that thing? Is it in line with your prioritization of values? If you have everything you need, could you be in a self-actualized state and not immediately know about it?</p>

<p>If the difficulty in dieting is not having too many cheat days, then the difficulty in mastering your mind is losing the ability to self-evaluate. Making time every evening to check in with yourself and ask what went right or wrong with your day is a great opportunity for self-evaluation and key to your self-discipline. I believe understanding the models above, as well as making time for self-reflection, can simplify the determination of your identity and future actions. You'd be at a loss to not have a system of self-sufficient support when you need it.</p>
