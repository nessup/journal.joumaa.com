###The desire to be important

The desire to be important drives some to insanity  
  
####Charles Schwab's guiding principle  
"I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop that best in a person is by appreciation and encouragement. There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise."  
  
###Flattery vs appreciation  
Flattery -> insincere, selfish  
Appreciation -> heart-felt, unselfish23  
Avoid flattery at all costs  
"Teach me neither to proffer nor receive cheap praise" - maxim from King George V's study  
  
Appreciation is the "legal tender that all souls enjoy." - Carnegie  
  
###A saying hung on Carnegie's mirror  
"I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness that I can show to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer or neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again."  
  
Principle 2: Give honest and sincere appreciation.  
  
My learning: Everyone wants to feel important. Identify every person's good points and praise them for it.  
  
##Chapter 3: "He Who Can Do This Has The Whole World With Him. He Who Cannot Walks A Lonely Way."  
  
####Creating action  
"Action springs out of what we fundamentally desire[â€¦] First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way."  
  
###Hotel vignette

"If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own."  
  
"People who can put themselves in the place of other people, who can understand the workings of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for them." - Owen D. Young

##Chapter 2: A Simple Way To Make A Good First Impression  
  
  
Smiling.  
  
"You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good time meeting you."  
  
"Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating action which is under more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not."  
  
"Most people are as happy as they make up their minds to be." - Abraham Lincoln

##Chapter 1: You Can't Win An Argument  
 
###Dinner party vignette

Carnegie and the other person consult with an expert also at the dinner party  
The expert kicks Carnegie under the table, tells Carnegie he is wrong and the other person is right  
The expert later explains that proving the other person wrong would only breed hatred  
  
"A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still."  
  
###Truck salesman vignette  
Truck salesman often was defensive about his product  
Argumentativeness hurt his sales  
After reform, he trained himself to agree with customers instead of get into an argument  
Agreeing with customers make it easier to talk about what he was offering  
Became a far better salesman  
  
"If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory sometimes, but it will be an empty victory because you will never get your opponent's good will." - Benjamin Franklin  
  
###Tax inspector vignette  
Tax inspector disputes the tax on a debt  
Stubbornly wishes to tax that debt  
The taxpayer stops arguing, instead says "you are probably right, I don't have that much experience"  
Conversation becomes a more pleasant one

Learning: Inspector's feeling of importance was removed when his demands were met, but a bigger feeling of importance came from being understood  
  
"Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love." - Buddha  
  
"No man resolved to make the most of himself can spare time for personal contention. Still less can he afford to take all the consequences, including the vitiating of his temper and loss of self control. Yield larger things to which you can show no more than equal right; and yield lesser ones, though clearly your own. Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog would not cure the bite." - Lincoln  
  
Principle 1: The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.  
  
##Chapter 2: A Sure Way Of Making Enemies -- And How To Avoid It  

Telling others they are wrong.  
  
"Men must be taught as you taught them not  
And things proposed as things forgot" - Alexander Pope  
  
Always respond to a contention by first admitting you might be wrong.  
  
Proving others wrong will not win their good will, which is far more valuable.

First time she proposed it to superiors, was rejected

###Lumber salesman vignette  
Customer angrily calls complaining wood is not of grade  
Salesman arrives, does not insinuate the customer is right  
Sees that the customer actually was improperly grading the wood  
Salesman did not contend there was an issue  
Salesman socratically asks about the requirements for each piece of wood  
Customer realizes they got what they paid for, check is sent in full  
Learning: arguing would not have lead to the customer changing his attitude  
  
Principle 2: Show respect for the other person's opinion. Never say (or imply) "you're wrong."  
  
##Chapter 3: If You're Wrong, Admit It

The next week, Carnegie was caught again  
Carnegie began by admitting he was in the wrong, should pay the fine  
The policeman let him off, suggesting he have the dog play where the policeman can't see him  
Learning: The policeman was robbed of his importance when Carnegie admitted fault the second time around, leading the policeman to regain importance by letting Carnegie off.  
  
When about to be caught red-handed, it's better to say all the things the other person is thinking before that person has the chance to say them. Self criticism said out loud > alien criticism said out loud

"By fighting you never get enough, but by yielding you get more than you asked for."  
  
Elbert Hubbard's admirable response to an irritated reader:  
  
"Come to think it over, I don't entirely agree with it myself. Not everything I wrote yesterday applies to me today. I am glad to learn what you think on the subject. The next time you are in the neighborhood, you must come visit us and we'll get this subject threshed out for all time. So here is a handclasp over the miles, and I am,  
  
Yours sincerely,  
Elbert Hubbard"  
Principle 3: If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.
